# Project Title

Creating an ethereum token of our own.

## Description
The `MyToken` contract defines a basic token with the name "META" and abbreviation "MTA". It utilizes a mapping to keep track of token balances for each address. The `mint` function increases the total token supply and adds tokens to a specified address. Conversely, the `burn` function reduces the total supply and removes tokens from an address if the balance is sufficient.


## Getting Started

tokens by minting ad burning them and see if it works.
